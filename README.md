Starter repository for Shopify theme development

## Features

- ES6 processing
- Vue widget integration

## Requirements
- [Node / NPM](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

## Setup

To get started, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/brianecook/shopify-starter.git
```

Open a new terminal tab in Visual Studio Code (or your preferred editor with an integrated terminal). Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After dependencies are installed run `npm start`. This will prompt you to log into the Shopify storefront that you plan on working on.

Once logged in, open a **separate** terminal tab. In this tab run `npm run watch`. This command will watch for changes in the scripts and styles directories and output the appropriate files in the assets folder.
